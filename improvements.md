### improvements in Robot passing
1. **Improvement of the p_controller() method**:Simplified the p_controller method by replacing repetitive code with a more general one. Specifically, the goal checking and velocity zeroing actions, which were previously duplicated, are now performed only once after the loop, saving processing time and making the code cleaner.

2. **Improvement in using class variables**: Some variables were passed to methods (like p_controller()) as arguments, despite the fact they are attributes of the class instance (like goals_X, goals_Y). Changed the methods to directly use the class attributes, which made the code more readable and reduced the chance of misusing these methods with incorrect arguments.

3. **Use of vector operations**: In the callback method, replaced individual operations on the components of vectors (like the computation of the Euclidean distance) with more efficient numpy vector operations. This both simplified the code and increased its efficiency, as numpy vector operations are generally faster than Python loops.

4. **Improvement of conditional logic**: The drive() method was simplified by removing a redundant if-else structure. Used a single line conditional operation to choose between two different actions based on the passing_state attribute.

5. **Improvement of error checking**: Inntroduced a check to make sure that the index 'i' used for accessing the goal coordinates is a valid integer. This should help prevent runtime errors related to invalid indexing.

6. **Removal of unnecessary variables**: Removed  'deltaz' in the p_controller() method, which was always set to 1 and then not used.

7. **Consolidated repeated code into functions**: Created a helper function to consolidate these repeated code sections. This makes the code more maintainable, easier to read, and reduces the chance of errors.

8. **Initialization of variables**: Made sure that all variables are initialized before use, especially for class variables. This is a good practice to prevent unexpected errors.


------
### Improvements in Robot_passing.py P-Controller()
- p_controller() now directly uses the class variables self.goals_X, self.goals_Y, and self.i, which makes the function easier to call and removes the need for passing these as parameters.

- The rotz matrix and deltas array creation are combined into a single line for conciseness.

n- p.arctan2() is used instead of math.atan2() to leverage numpy's efficient computation.

- The angle normalization is done more concisely using the modulus operator, instead of conditional statements.

- The maximum value of c_v and c_w is set more concisely using the min() function.

- The condition checking if the goal is reached is unchanged. However, the print statement now includes the current goal index for better debugging.

- The termination condition when all goals are reached now correctly sets velocities to zero and prints a completion message.
